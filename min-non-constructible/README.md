<div class="html">
<p>
  Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your
  possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the
  minimum sum of money) that you <b>cannot</b> create. The given coins can have
  any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have
  multiple coins of the same value).
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you're given <span>coins = [1, 2, 5]</span>, the minimum
  amount of change that you can't create is <span>4</span>. If you're given no
  coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is <span>1</span>.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">coins</span> = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>20
</pre>
