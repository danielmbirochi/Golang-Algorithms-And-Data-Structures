      Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
      whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
      in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
      instance, the numbers <span>[1, 3, 4]</span> form a subsequence of the array
      <span>[1, 2, 3, 4]</span>, and so do the numbers <span>[2, 4]</span>. Note
      that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
      subsequences of the array.

    <h3>Sample Input</h3>
    <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
    <span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">sequence</span> = [1, 6, -1, 10]
    </pre>
    <h3>Sample Output</h3>
    <pre>true
    </pre>
